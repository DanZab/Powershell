# Powershell
Collection of Work-Related Powershell Scripts

I do a lot of Windows Server, Active Directory, and SCCM related scripting. This repo is a collection of scripts for various tasks that are not necessarily organization-specific.

If you use powershell frequently, I would recommend looking at the Script-Components.ps1 file, which is a small collection of useful components I've accumulated over time that I incorporate into other scripts or daily use.
